      Cell Projecct was assinged to me by my teacher. I had to make a model of a cell using craft materials. I made a Plant Cell using a shoe box, colored paper, and other craft supplies. i learned about how to use a 1602 lcd screen with I2C module to display organell names using
      a remote control. also when i selected an organell on a screen, it will light up a led on an organell. I learned a lot about the different parts of a cell and how they work together to keep the cell functioning. This project helped me understand the basics of arduino programming and basic soldering.
      I am proud of how my Plant Cell model turned out and the effort I put into making it. This project was a fun and educational experience that helped me learn more about cells and electronics.
